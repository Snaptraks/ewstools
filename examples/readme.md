# Examples
**A collection of iPython notebooks demonstrating applications of ewstools.**

### ews_single.ipynb

Simulates a single trajectory of the Ricker model undergoing a Fold and Flip bifurcation
and computes EWS.


### ews_multi.ipynb

Simulates multiple trajectories of the Ricker model undergoing a Fold and Flip bifurcation
and computes ensemble averages of EWS.


### ews_bootstrap.ipynb

Simulates a single trajectory of the Ricker model undergoing a Fold and Flip bifurcation, 
computes bootstrapped time-series from rolling window segments, and computes the
evolving distribution of EWS.

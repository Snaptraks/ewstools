# Examples
**A collection of iPython notebooks demonstrating applications of ewstools.**

## ricker_single.ipynb

Simulates a single trajectory of the Ricker model undergoing a Fold bifurcation
and computes EWS.


## ricker_multi.ipynb

Simulates multiple trajectories of the Ricker model undergoing a Fold bifurcation
and computes ensemble averages of EWS.


## ricker_stat.ipynb

Simulates **stationary** trajectories of the Ricker model at different parameter values
preceding the Fold bifurcation.


## ricker_bootstrap.ipynb

Simulates a single trajectory of the Ricker model undergoing a Fold bifurcation, computes
bootstrapped time-series from this trajectory, and the corresponding distribution of EWS.

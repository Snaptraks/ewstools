# Demos/Tutorials
**A collection of iPython notebooks demonstrating various applications of ewstools.**

### ews_single.ipynb
- Simulate a single stochastic trajectory of the Ricker model going through a Fold bifurcation
- Show how to use the package *ewstools* to compute early warning signals
- Visualise the output of *ewstools* graphically


### ews_multi.ipynb

Simulates multiple trajectories of the Ricker model undergoing a Fold and Flip bifurcation
and computes ensemble averages of EWS.


### ews_bootstrap.ipynb

Simulates a single trajectory of the Ricker model undergoing a Fold and Flip bifurcation, 
computes bootstrapped time-series from rolling window segments, and computes the
evolving distribution of EWS.

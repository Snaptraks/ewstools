# Demos/Tutorials
**A collection of iPython notebooks demonstrating various applications of *ewstools*.**

### ews_fold.ipynb
- Simulates a single stochastic trajectory of the Ricker model going through a Fold bifurcation
- Shows how to use *ewstools* to compute early warning signals
- Visualises the output of *ewstools* graphically


### ews_bootstrap.ipynb
- Simulates a trajectories of the Ricker model going through a Flip and a Fold bifurcadtion
- Uses *ewstools* to compute bootstrapped time-series and the corresponding EWS.
- Visualises the output, comparing the two bifurcations.

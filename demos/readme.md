# Demos/Tutorials
**A collection of iPython notebooks demonstrating various applications of *ewstools*.**

To run and interact with these demos, Jupyter notebook must be installed on your system, which can be found [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

### ews_fold.ipynb
- Simulates a single stochastic trajectory of the Ricker model going through a Fold bifurcation
- Shows how to use *ewstools* to compute early warning signals
- Visualises the output of *ewstools* graphically
- Run time < 1 min


### ews_bootstrap.ipynb
- Simulates single stochastic trajectories of the Ricker model going through a Flip bifurcation
- Uses *ewstools* to compute bootstrapped time-series and the corresponding EWS.
- Visualises the output, comparing the two bifurcations.
- Run time < 3 mins
